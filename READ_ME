This repository contains code associated to the analysis run for the manuscript: “Group size and composition influence collective movement in a highly social terrestrial bird” 
by Papageorgiou and Farine. This work investigates how group size and composition influence collective movement in groups of vulturine guineafowl (Accryllium vulturinum) 
which range freely in the Kenyan savannah. The raw GPS data that were collected for this study are stored in the Movebank data repository: 
https://www.movebank.org/cms/webapp?gwt_fragment=page=studies,path=study475851705

The first script (1.get&prepare_data.R) includes the steps for downloading data from movebank, excluding outliers and creating a dataset that only contains one GPS fix 
every five minutes.

The second script (2.code_hr_aov_dtd.R) provides the code to calculate home range (AKDE, question 1), the tendency for groups to use the same areas on consecutive days 
(question 2) and daily travelled distance (question 3), using the ctmm package. The input data in this script is a data file that contains for each group, in each season, 
one GPS fix every five minutes.

The third script (3.code_sotg.R) calculates for each group in one season, the speed while travelling (question 4), using high resolution data (one GPS fix every second).

The fourth script (4.GEEs_fitness.R) has as input data the Computed_seasonal_measurements.Rdata file, which has the same information as the Supplementary File 1A, 
and calculates the GEEs for fitness, measured as the number of chicks in groups of various sizes. These GEEs are presented in Supplementary File 1F. 

The fourth script (5.GEEs_hr_aov_dtd_sotg.R) has as input data the Computed_seasonal_measurements.Rdata file, which has the same data as the Supplementary File 1A, 
and calculates all GEEs for questions 1-4, all of these GEEs are presented in the Supplementary Files 1B-1E.
